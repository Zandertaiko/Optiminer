# OptiminerZ/Zcash

GPU miner for Zcash.

## v0.5.0 (Beta)
[Download Linux 64bit](https://github.com/Optiminer/OptiminerZcash/raw/master/optiminer-zcash-0.5.0.tar.gz)
[Download Windows 64bit](https://github.com/Optiminer/OptiminerZcash/raw/master/optiminer-zcash-0.5.0.zip)

Supports:
- Linux and Windows 64bit only.
- AMD GCN cards only.

Expected speed (stock card):
- R9 Nano: 205 S/s
- R9 290: 155 S/s
- RX 480: 145 S/s

Windows support may be added in a future version.

No NVIDIA support planned at the moment.

The miner contains a fee for supporting the dev. All shown hash rates are
net rate, i.e., with fee deducted. What you see is what You get!

## Usage:
Run from the archive root directory:
$ ./optiminer-zcash -s eu1-zcash.flypool.org:3333 -u t1Yszagk1jBjdyPfs2GxXx1GWcfn6fdTuFJ.example -p password

For a list of all options run with '-h':
$ ./optiminer-zcash -h

There are also 'mine.sh' and 'start.bat' scripts for running it under
Windows and Unix. Just edit the pool and user settings before running!

## Troubleshooting

### Intensity
Starting with version 0.5.0, there is an intensity option (-i). Higher
intensity generally means faster hashing. But if it is too high, the miner
might crash or have very poor performance. The miner tries to auto-detect
the best intensity for your card but you can experiment with different
values.

E.g., adding '-i 2' to command line sets intensity to 2 for all cards. If
you have multiple card you can specify one '-i' for each card, e.g., if you
have four cards '-i 3 -i 4 -i 4 -i 3' (same order as -d). An intensity value
of 0 means auto-detect.

### `GLIBCXX_3.4.20' not found on Ubuntu 14.04
Install the required libstc++:
```shell
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-toolchain-r/test 
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install libstdc++6
```

### Failed to read bin/X_base.bin
You need to run the miner from the directroy where optiminer-zcash is in
otherwise it will not find the opencl kernel.

### libOpenCL.so.1 cannot open object
There is a problem with your OpenCL installation. Make sure that there is a
symlink /usr/lib/libOpenCL.so.1 that points to the OpenCL library on your
system.
